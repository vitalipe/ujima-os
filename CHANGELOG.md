# Changelog

All notable changes to Ujima, newest first.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
A release's version is its **git tag** (`vX.Y.Z`) — tags are the only source of
version truth; branch names and build labels may disagree.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The machine's own storage reports itself on the places stream — including,
  truthfully, a partition that failed to mount, instead of pretending all is well.
- A drive labeled `UJIMAOS1` is an ujima drive: people's files live in its
  `files/` folder with ujima's cargo beside them; any other drive browses whole,
  and only labeled ujima drives are ever read for tokens.
- A USB drive mounts read-write when plugged in — vfat, exFAT and ext4, checked
  and repaired first when dirty; NTFS and everything else mounts read-only.
- The desktop serves a places stream: the machine's Files area and every mounted
  drive, with the tokens a drive carries (circle admin, a registered pack).
- A machine upgrades itself: `bb dev upgrade <ip> <pack>` installs a pack into
  the device's inactive slot and carries its settings across; `bb dev boot <ip>`
  try-boots the prepared slot and commits it once the device comes back.
- `ujimactl` — the runtime's one-shot CLI on every machine: migration
  export/seed and the upgrade verbs (info, install, migrate, boot, commit).
- Installing a pack streams real progress — validate, boot image, root image,
  verify, record — instead of going dark for the whole write.
- Every control in the bar names itself on hover — the apps, the close button, the
  keyboard layout, the speaker, and the date behind the clock.
- The keyboard layout opens on hover to show the other installed layouts, each one a
  direct pick rather than something to cycle to; the row closes as soon as you pick.
- The user's home is the Places screen: one entry per place, named as its card
  (Temporary, This Computer, USB Stick), kept in step as drives come and go.
  Every GTK file dialog opens there, with the crumb trail collapsed behind home.

### Changed

- A stick's ujima cargo lives in one visible `ujima/` folder: the circle admin
  token is `ujima/circle.json` (was `.ujima-admin-token` at the root, which no
  longer counts), and `ujima/install.json` registers a pack by path.
- ONLYOFFICE opens in a ujima theme — the desktop's charcoal and the office category
  colour around a light document editor.
- The Web app's browser frame and tab strip follow the desktop's charcoal instead of
  Chromium's own grey.
- ONLYOFFICE draws no window buttons of its own — a document closes from ujima's bar,
  like every other app.
- Locking no longer starts a program of its own: the lock screen is part of the desktop
  shell, comes up at once over the wallpaper, and leaves what was open untouched behind it.
- The live-deploy target is `bb dev push <ip> runtime` (was `ujimad`), and a
  push now ships the runtime's entry-point wrappers along with the code.
- Volume lives in the bar itself: hovering the speaker slides a slider out beside it,
  and either the speaker or the number mutes. The separate volume panel is gone.
- The close button in the top pane is a red ✕ you can see, not a faint grey mark.
- The speaker icon shows roughly how loud the machine is, and the layout code sits
  beside a keyboard icon instead of standing alone.
- The bar's text is a step larger.
- The bar shows the keyboard layouts as a fixed cycle with the current one last, so
  the leftmost is always the one super+space switches to next.
- Anything an activity has pinned wears a padlock in the bar and cannot be changed there,
  sound and the keyboard layout alike: the volume track greys out, the layout picker will
  not open, and when sound is pinned off the volume panel stays shut too.
- Moving the volume unmutes when you let go of the slider, so a machine you muted stays
  silent while you set the level.

- The Console finds machines two ways: one that announces itself on the network appears
  in about a second, and the subnet sweep still runs behind it — so a class fills in
  promptly even where an access point throttles the sweep.
- The disk carries each slot's settings on that slot's own partition and the journal on
  a partition of its own: a corrupt settings filesystem now halts only its slot instead
  of both, a failed slot's logs stay readable from the one that boots, and user files
  filling the disk can no longer squeeze the journal out. Settings and logs stop on the
  first filesystem error rather than writing on; the machine id moved to the control
  partition. Disks installed with the old layout must be re-installed.
- The Console rescans the circle each time its home screen opens, so a machine that was
  still coming up during the first sweep appears on its own instead of waiting for Rescan.
- GTK file dialogs lose their left panel: no Recent, Trash, Other Locations or
  bookmarks — the crumb trail and the folder view remain. Apps' default folder
  is Temporary (documents, downloads, pictures; Inkscape and Geany first runs).
- The places stream names each place; the Files app shows that name, numbering
  sticks only when more than one is plugged in.
- The session place lives at `~/Temporary` (was `~/files`).
- The launcher is a native window drawn the way the Files app is, not a web page in
  an embedded browser: the same home screen, at a fraction of the memory, and the
  browser engine that carried it leaves the image.

### Fixed

- A machine answers to its own name on the network. Every machine used to announce
  itself as `ujimaos`, so two of them on one network fought over the name and which one
  you reached depended on boot order; each now announces `ujima-<serial>` from the moment
  it starts.

### Removed

- The "Home" → "Temporary" relabel of the GTK dialog sidebar — the sidebar is gone.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-25

Fleet control: a USB admin token opens the Console — the Circle app runs every
machine in the circle, the Setup app configures one — over subnet discovery and
an HMAC-signed device API. Underneath: one `/ujima` root, a persistent machine
identity, and a clock that never runs backwards.

### Added

- Ujima Circle App: a fleet control panel for teachers — every machine in the
  circle, what each one is running, and sound, apps and power over a selection.
- Ujima Setup App: per-machine setup over the same circle — name, clock
  (timezone + wall time), keyboard layouts and sound output, plus a machine's
  identity, address, uptime, storage and warnings.
- A usb stick carrying an admin token opens the Console: removable partitions
  are mounted read-only under `/ujima/run/storage/<uuid>` and scanned for it,
  and the token has to be this machine's own circle key or the stick is
  ignored. The Console pins beside Files in the dock while the token is in —
  closing its window leaves the icon, a tap reopens it — and pulling the stick
  closes the Console after a few seconds.
- The Console finds its circle by sweeping the local subnet, and keeps sweeping
  every 45 seconds while open, so a machine that boots later just appears: one
  that answers and holds the same admin token joins the list, one that stops
  answering stays on it marked off. Rescan always answers with a sweep that
  started no earlier than the press; machines that belong to another circle are
  counted, never listed.
- Lock the screen from the Circle app: a machine shows a full-screen Locked
  page (no switching, no closing) until a teacher unlocks it or the circle
  token releases it; unlocking returns to whatever was open, and a locked
  machine refuses the hold verbs — only unlocking leaves a lock.
- Hold a machine to one app filling the screen — no switching, closing or
  keyboard chords, automatic relaunch if it exits, the app's own dialogs
  (Open/Save) still usable. `desktop/focus` takes it (with no app named,
  whatever that machine has open right now), `desktop/release` or inserting
  the circle token lets go. The Circle app holds a class from one panel —
  Focus, Release and Close (closing a held app releases the hold first) —
  with held machines showing which app they are held in.
- Every machine mints a persistent identity at first boot: a generated system
  id on the settings partition, surviving A/B installs and board swaps; the
  machine API reports it as `id` (null until a first boot stamps it).
- The machine API reports the deployed version: `query/machine/image` answers
  the stamp written at build/deploy (git tag, plus commit id past a tag,
  `-dirty` for uncommitted trees); images from before the stamp answer null.
- The clock never boots backwards: a heartbeat records witnessed time on the
  settings partition and boot lifts a lagging clock to it — wall time stays
  monotonic across power loss on battery-less boards.
- `hwclock` ships (`util-linux-extra`): a set clock persists to the Pi's RTC,
  surviving reboots while the board has power.
- The device API on :1337 can answer in edn: `?format=edn` on any data route
  (JSON stays the default; files and streams are unaffected).
- Wifi is a setting: `[:network :wifi :essid]` (default `ujima-default-circle`)
  + `:psk` (nil = open network) name the network to join and `:mode` (`:peer` |
  `:off`) drives the radio — circle-wide, with a per-device override; seeded at
  install like any setting, re-asserted at every boot.
- A wired link with no DHCP answer falls back to a zeroconf (169.254/16)
  address, so a circle on a bare switch stays addressable.
- The OS image boots as-is — `dd` it to a card for a system without A/B, where
  settings and storage are not persistent.
- The image bakes ujima's bb libraries into `/ujima/m2` (pinned, sha-verified
  at build); like packages, they never change on a live deploy.
- Desktop windows fade in on open and out on close (~130ms), as do the shell's
  popovers and the bars hiding for a fullscreen app.

### Changed

- Everything on-device lives under one root — `/ujima`: code at
  `/ujima/ujimad`, desktop at `/ujima/desktop`, apps at `/ujima/apps` (was
  `/opt/ujima`); the desktop helpers and `/usr/games` ride the session `PATH`.
- The storage partition mounts directly at `/ujima/storage` (was
  `/mnt/storage`): the Files area is `/ujima/storage/files`, extra apps
  `/ujima/storage/apps`.
- An installed system records itself in two files at the slot root — the build
  stamp `/ujima/image.edn` (version, base image) and the install record
  `/ujima/install.edn` (the pack's manifest, installed-at, slot); was
  `metadata.edn` + `install.edn`.
- The in-session daemon is `/usr/local/bin/ujimad` (was `ujima-agent`).
- The USB admin token is the file `.ujima-admin-token` (was
  `.ujima-control-token`).
- The device API on :1337 has one shape: reads under `/api/query/`, writes
  under `/api/commands/`. The old per-subject paths are gone.
- The desktop's own surface — its streams, verbs, app catalog and files — now
  answers on `127.0.0.1:1336` under `/ujima-desktop/`, and is no longer
  reachable from the LAN; `:1337` serves `/api` only. Per-app icons moved from
  `GET /app/icon/<id>` to `GET /ujima-desktop/assets/app-icon/<id>`.
- The device API answers commands and settings reads only to a signed request,
  and signs every response; machine facts under `/api/query/machine/` stay
  open.
- Setting a machine's clock can carry its timezone, so one call moves both; a
  zone the machine does not know is refused and the clock is left untouched.
- Renaming a machine changes only its display name (`system.name`, shown with
  the serial's last 4 digits); the OS hostname is fixed at
  `ujima-<serial-last4>` with `/etc/hosts` kept in step, so a rename can no
  longer break running apps or the machine's network name, and `sudo` no
  longer warns "unable to resolve host".
- Wifi power saving is off on every connection: dozing turned ~10ms LAN round
  trips into 40-100ms medians with seconds-scale outliers, for at most ~0.2W
  on mains-powered machines.

### Fixed

- The home screen's identity line is live: the machine's real name and serial
  tail replace a hardcoded name and a fake Online/"Room to work" status pill;
  a change landing while the home screen is hidden shows as soon as it is
  visible again.
- Stellarium starts windowed instead of taking the whole screen with no way
  out — the top bar's close button is always reachable.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-28

First app support: an app is a self-contained directory (`app.edn` + icon +
payload) discovered by a boot-time catalog scan.

### Added

- App kinds — `app.edn` declares `:kind` (`:exec` / `:web-app` / `:link`);
  apps launch with their app dir as cwd.
- Persistent Files — the file manager and every save/open dialog center on
  `/mnt/storage/files` (survives reboots and OS updates); home is "Temporary".
- Multi-root catalog — `/mnt/storage/apps` is scanned alongside the baked
  `/opt/ujima/apps`; an app dropped onto storage joins the launcher.
- Per-app icons — the app dir owns `icon.svg`, served at `GET /app/icon/<id>`.
- Web-app runtime scripts — `ujima-open-web-app` (one chromium kiosk wrapper
  for all web apps) and `ujima-serve-web-app` (serve a vendored SPA, open it,
  reap the server on close).
- App scopes run under no-new-privs — `sudo` can't elevate from inside an app.
- First-run app defaults — Thonny, Geany and GIMP dark (GIMP defers to the
  system Nordic theme); GIMP, Inkscape and LibreOffice first-run
  popups/infobars off.
- Keyboard chords — Alt+F4 closes (double-press force-kills), Alt+Tab /
  Alt+Shift+Tab cycle running apps, Alt+Escape goes home leaving the app
  running.

### Changed

- The catalog is built at boot by scanning per-app `app.edn` files
  (`assets/apps/<id>/` baked to `/opt/ujima/apps/<id>/`); the app id is the
  directory name; a broken app dir is skipped and logged, never killing the
  session.
- Excalidraw launches through `ujima-serve-web-app`.
- The Web browser runs in guest mode — each browsing session is ephemeral, with
  no history or cookies kept; downloads still land in Files.

### Removed

- The generated central `apps.edn` — per-app `app.edn` is the runtime truth;
  `appcatalog.clj` keeps only the install recipes.
- Excalidraw's bespoke `run.sh`.

### Fixed

- `systemctl restart ujima` tears down the whole session, wedged ujimad included,
  and the next start reclaims display `:0` — no orphaned desktop serving old code.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-14

The Ujima desktop shell — first tagged release: Raspberry Pi 5 image build,
read-only root, a babashka settings daemon (ujimad), an i3 + eww + WebKitGTK shell, and a
~20-app catalog.

- **Image build** — `bb tools` builds the flashable Pi image end-to-end: Debian
  trixie rootfs, staged install scripts, pinned packages, per-slot settings and
  shared storage under `/ujima`.
- **Read-only OS** — `/` locked via an overlayroot tmpfs overlay (baked
  initramfs, pinned machine-id); journald persists to storage, capped and
  priority-tagged.
- **Settings daemon (ujimad)** — desired-vs-actual converge over path-vector setting
  keys; HTTP `/api` + `/ui` on `:1337`; pure event sources (audio, USB storage)
  feeding stateless policies; reads shell out to nothing.
- **Audio** — PipeWire layer: per-class volumes, machine-wide mute, output
  switching, hotplug converge on `[:audio :active]`.
- **Keyboard** — live layout switching via setxkbmap, control-owned.
- **App layer** — passive projection over i3: workspace = app identity,
  run/switch/close verbs, systemd `--user` scopes for liveness and force-kill,
  second same-app windows cover instead of tile, dialogs float with their app,
  fullscreen apps hide the bars.
- **Shell UI** — WebKitGTK launcher plus eww top bar and dock; charcoal skin,
  lucide icons, vendored Public Sans, colour-coded categories
  (Learn / Office / Create / Web & Files), gradient background.
- **App catalog** — ~20 education/office/creative apps with install recipes
  (`:apt` / `:fetch` / `:deb`): LibreOffice Writer/Calc/Impress, ONLYOFFICE,
  GIMP 3, Godot 4 (Vulkan Mobile + bundled 2D demo), Stellarium, Marble, XaoS,
  Excalidraw (offline PWA), Chromium, Kolibri stub, and more; per-app first-run
  defaults staged from `assets/apps/<id>/rootfs`; Qt apps themed dark.
- **Cold boot** — X-auth race and hostname-converge stall fixed; power-on to
  desktop ~85s → ~20-25s.
- **Dev rig** — live `dev push` / `dev script` deploy to a dev Pi, e2e runner,
  screenshot/drive tooling.
