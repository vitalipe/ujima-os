(ns lib.cli
  "Small command-tree wrapper around babashka.cli.

   Defines a nested command map and turns it into a babashka.cli dispatch table.
   Nesting is arbitrary: a node with a :target is a command, anything else groups
   commands, so `noun verb` and `noun sub verb` are both expressible.

   Example:

     (ns my.tools
       (:require [lib.cli :as cli]))

     (defn hello!
       [{:keys [name loud]}]
       (println
         (cond-> (str \"hello \" name)
           loud clojure.string/upper-case)))

     (def command-tree
       {\"greet\"
        {\"hello\"
         {:usage \"Usage: tools greet hello <name> [--loud]\"
          :target hello!
          :args [:name]
          :spec {:name {:desc \"Name to greet\"
                        :require true}
                 :loud {:desc \"Print in uppercase\"
                        :coerce :boolean}}}}})

     (cli/dispatch! command-tree args))

   Supported command entry keys:

     :usage   Command usage string.
     :target  Function called with parsed opts.
     :args    Positional argument names, passed to babashka.cli as :args->opts.
     :spec    babashka.cli option spec.
     :coerce  Optional babashka.cli coercion map.

   Example invocation:

     your-script greet hello world --loud"
  (:require
    [babashka.cli :as cli]
    [clojure.string :as str]
    [lib.task :as task]
    [lib.task.timeline :as timeline]))
