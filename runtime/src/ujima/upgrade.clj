  "Install a pack into the slot this machine is NOT running from, carry its settings across,

   No verb takes a slot — it is always the other one. The host CLI picks slots because it
   works on a card in a reader; a machine upgrading itself never should.

   Long verbs return cold flows and print nothing: progress is timeline events, so the same
   call renders on a terminal, streams to the setup button, or runs headless."
