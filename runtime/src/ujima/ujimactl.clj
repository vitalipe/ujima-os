  "The runtime invoked ONCE, beside ujimad's long-running face — same code, another entry
   point, reached through /usr/local/bin/ujimactl. The twin of tools.cli: one command tree
   on lib.cli, one -main.

   The migration-family verbs speak EDN on one path — entries on stdin, the report map on
   stdout, stderr only when something actually failed. Their callers are programs: an
   installer chrooting a slot, an upgrade piping one slot's export into another slot's seed.

   Some verbs act on this machine's disk and some belong to the daemon. `migration seed`
   writes a store no daemon owns and can never route anywhere; applying comes in two
   shapes that are NOT interchangeable — see `seed!`."
